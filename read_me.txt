This fold is about a system configuration case created and verified by AMTC. here are several sub-folds:
1. database: this fold contains the data of four feature dividing schemes and processes, equipment, tools, fixtures.

2. quinary_combination: this fold contains the feasible five-element-combinations under different feature dividing schemes.

3. results_test1~4: these folds contain configraution results of each calculation and each feature dividing scheme and each algorithm.


for the file under each calculation test and each feature dividing schemes:
1. files with "best_front" as the name's prefix:
recording the final best front, the columns are [five-element-combination sequence, selected equipment's indexes, locations of different types selected equipment, four optimization obiectives' vlalues]

2. files with "object" as the name's prefix:
recording the four optimization obiectives' vlalues of each iteration's best front, the columns are [iteration steps, iteration time used, four optimization obiectives' vlalues (occupying four columns)]

2. files with "time" as the name's prefix:
recording the total time used
